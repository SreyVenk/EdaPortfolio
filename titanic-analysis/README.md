# Titanic EDA Project 🚢

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to identify key patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- **File used**: `Titanic-Dataset.xls`

---

## 📊 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, remove irrelevant columns)
- Analyze the distribution of passenger features (age, gender, class, fare, etc.)
- Visualize relationships between features and survival outcomes
- Extract actionable insights for future modeling

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Women had a much higher survival rate** than men.
- **1st class passengers** were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- **Younger passengers** (especially children) had a higher chance of survival.
- **Fare price** showed some positive correlation with survival (higher fare → better odds).
- **Age** had a slight negative trend with survival (older → less likely to survive).

## 📎 Files Included

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `Titanic-Dataset.xls` – Original dataset
- `README.md` – Project overview

---

## 📌 Next Steps (Optional)

- Perform feature engineering (e.g., create family size from SibSp + Parch)
- Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Create a Streamlit app for interactive visualization
